# Brain Tumor Detection using TensorFlow

## Description

This project involves developing a deep learning model using TensorFlow to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The model is trained to classify images into 'tumor' and 'no tumor' categories with high accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Brain_Tumor_Detection_MRI** by ABHRANTA PANIGRAHI from Kaggle. It consists of three folders:
- **yes:** Images with brain tumors
- **no:** Images without brain tumors
- **pred:** Images for prediction

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abhrantapanigrahi/brain-tumor-detection-mri).

## Key Features

- **Data Preparation:** Loading and preprocessing MRI images.
- **Model Architecture:** Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Training and Validation:** Training the model with labeled data and validating its performance.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's accuracy and performance metrics.
- **Visualization:** Displaying sample images and prediction results.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
